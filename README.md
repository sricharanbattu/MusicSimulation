#MusicSimulation

This Project aspires to simulate a complete orchestra

We will first simulate the crude notes from C1 to B9

Then we will try to simulate the all these notes from instruments like Piano, drum, chello, guitar, flute etc.

Then we can try to play a musical piece from the simulated notes

Then we can play a complete orchestra
